# Executive Summary
Software is a vital piece to any computing system for it to operate sucessfully. Software tells the hardware what to do, and without it hardware would just be physical pieces without purpose. There are two major kinds of software, those being operating systems and application software. Application software is software that does something helpful for the computer user and is usually a program within the computer. Operating systems however create the user interface and manage system resources that are given by the computers hardware. Windows, OSX, android or Linux are all exampls of operating systems. Operating systems have come a long way over time and can harness more memory and process even more data. These pieces of software have been continually improved by large companies such as Apple or Windows. Linux as stated above is an operating system that is growing very strong and is creating more opprotunities for computer users. Microsoft seems to have a strong role in the world of business computing, this is because in 1981 mMicrosoft teamed with IBM to release the PC. For a long time IBM was the strongest manufacturer of computer manifraimes and most companies that had computers incorporated within their business would have an IBM brand machine. To play things safe, business consumers decided to stick by thier trusted brand and Microsoft kept growing with new software and new computers. Microsoft gained a lot of popularity and consumers would continue to stick with their trusted brand. This is why Microsoft seems to have an advantage in the competition of computers, exceeding other companies such as Apple, at least in the business world. Application software is just as important as operating system software, only it couldnt exist without operating software to creat the interface for the user or manage system resources to run an application. Examples of application software would be games that ypu run on your computer, applications such as microsoft word for typing a document, or a music software application such as Itunes. Spreadsheet software became a very useful program for users and business, microsoft and apple were both able to release their own version relativley early on in the lives of personal computers.
