# Executive Summary
Software is a vital piece to any computing system for it to operate sucessfully. Software tells the hardware what to do, and without it hardware would just be physical pieces without purpose. Software is always written in a specific computer language that the computer can read, such as PHP, C# or HTML. There are two major kinds of software, those being operating systems and application software. Application software is software that does something helpful for the computer user and is usually a program within the computer. Operating systems however create the user interface and manage system resources that are given by the computers hardware. These pieces of software also allow a platform for applications to be written. Windows, OSX, android or Linux are all exampls of operating systems. Operating systems have come a long way over time and can harness more memory and process even more data. These pieces of software have been continually improved by large companies such as Apple or Windows. Linux as stated above is an operating system that is growing very strong and is creating more opprotunities for computer users. Microsoft seems to have a strong role in the world of business computing, this is because in 1981 mMicrosoft teamed with IBM to release the PC. For a long time IBM was the strongest manufacturer of computer manifraimes and most companies that had computers incorporated within their business would have an IBM brand machine. To play things safe, business consumers decided to stick by thier trusted brand and Microsoft kept growing with new software and new computers. Microsoft gained a lot of popularity and consumers would continue to stick with their trusted brand. This is why Microsoft seems to have an advantage in the competition of computers, exceeding other companies such as Apple, at least in the business world. Application software is just as important as operating system software, only it couldnt exist without operating software to creat the interface for the user or manage system resources to run an application. Examples of application software would be games that ypu run on your computer, applications such as microsoft word for typing a document, or a music software application such as Itunes. Spreadsheet software became a very useful program for users and business, microsoft and apple were both able to release their own version relativley early on in the lives of personal computers. A lot of software has been created with production in mind for businesses. Software applications such as spreadsheet,  word processing, and even presentation software has been created soley for production purposes. Microsoft powerpoint has proven to be the most popular presentation software in a business setting. However, advancements to this software typer are of course still being made. Applications such as utility software has made it more effective for computer users to perform utility tasks for their computers. Programming software has made it easier for programmers to write code and test it. There are many kinds of useful application software. Software licensing protects programmers and computer companies from unethical use or distribution of their software. However, programmers and software developers can leave their work or programs open souced. This means that anyone can download it and edit it to make improvments but this also removes the potential profitable gain a programmer can earn from his or her hard work. Closed sourced software is generally licesned software that can cost money so the programmer may get their investment of hard work and time back. It is said that closed source software develops more slowly because there are less people who can potentially edit and make improvemensts to it. The use of new application software has caused controversy between different departments of the same business. Some large businesses would need to be more connected with the business as a whole, so ERP software was released in 1990's. This software would centralize a lot of the businesses computer operations, making computers more efficient for businesses. Customer relationship manement Software has also helped businesses become more centralized by creating a more efficient way to develop important business relationships with their customers. Supply chain mangement software has also tremedounly helped businesses with manageing their inventory and demand for new stock and creating better communication bewteen them and their ditributors and manufactueres.  The year 2000 caused a problem for many computer consumers as the popular software of the day only had two digits allocated for the date. This would not be compatible in a new century and this problem affected business all over the world, requiring them to have their computers recoded for correct dates. The ERP software that was released in the 1990's aimed to prevent this problem by having four digits for the dates, it was an obvious upgrade choice of sofetware for a lot of prepared busniesses. Software has also been specifically made just for the growing phone industry, which is becoming more popular than personal computers. Android and IOS are the two most popular operating systems for cell phones today. A popular form of storage today is cloud computing. With cloud computing web develpers and programmers are allowed to provide services and applications using storage over the internet. This reduces the need to install extra storage physically on computers. Cloud computing over the internet also allows private cloud usage for businesses that would like to be more reclusive with their data. From creating more virtual storage to even allowing simulation of other computers to runb on your very own computer, cloud computing is definilety a useful thing for just about anyone using the internet or a computer. It is true that software and other advancements such as cloud computing will continue to make businesses and their operations more effective and efficient, creating a more productive tomorrow..
