# Executive Summary
Software is a vital piece to any computing system for it to operate sucessfully. Software tells the hardware what to do, and without it hardware would just be physical pieces without purpose. There are two major kinds of software, those being operating systems and application software. Application software is software that does something helpful for the computer user and is usually a program within the computer. Operating systems however create the user interface and manage system resources that are given by the computers hardware. These pieces of software also allow a platform for applications to be written. Windows, OSX, android or Linux are all exampls of operating systems. Operating systems have come a long way over time and can harness more memory and process even more data. These pieces of software have been continually improved by large companies such as Apple or Windows. Linux as stated above is an operating system that is growing very strong and is creating more opprotunities for computer users. Microsoft seems to have a strong role in the world of business computing, this is because in 1981 mMicrosoft teamed with IBM to release the PC. For a long time IBM was the strongest manufacturer of computer manifraimes and most companies that had computers incorporated within their business would have an IBM brand machine. To play things safe, business consumers decided to stick by thier trusted brand and Microsoft kept growing with new software and new computers. Microsoft gained a lot of popularity and consumers would continue to stick with their trusted brand. This is why Microsoft seems to have an advantage in the competition of computers, exceeding other companies such as Apple, at least in the business world. Application software is just as important as operating system software, only it couldnt exist without operating software to creat the interface for the user or manage system resources to run an application. Examples of application software would be games that ypu run on your computer, applications such as microsoft word for typing a document, or a music software application such as Itunes. Spreadsheet software became a very useful program for users and business, microsoft and apple were both able to release their own version relativley early on in the lives of personal computers. A lot of software has been created with production in mind for businesses. Software applications such as spreadsheet,  word processing, and even presentation software has been created soley for production purposes. Microsfoft powerpoint has proven to be the most popular presentation softwar in a business setting. However, advancements to this software typer are of course still being made. Applications such as utility software has made it more effective for computer users to perform utility tasks for their computers. Programming software has made it easier for programmers to write code and test it. There are many kinds of useful application software. Software licensing protects programmes and computer companies from unethical use or distribution of their software. The use of new application software has caused controversy between different departments of the same business. Some large businesses would need to be more connected with the business as a whole, so ERP software was released in 1990's. This software would centralize a lot of the businesses computer operations, making computers more efficient for businesses. The year 2000 caused a problem for many computer consumers as the popular software of the day only had two digits allocated for the date. This would not be compatible in a new century and this problem affected business all over the world, requiring them to have their computers recoded for correct dates. The ERP software that was released in the 1990's aimed to prevent this problem by having four digits for the dates, it was an obvious upgrade choice of sofetware for a lot of prepared busniesses.
