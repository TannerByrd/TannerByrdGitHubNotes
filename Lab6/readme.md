# Executive Summary 
# Internet Architecture

### Internet Protocol
An IP address is an internet protocol address and is the numbers assigned to a specific computer network. IPv4 addresses are a used up source of internet adresses, with all the new allocations for new addresses using IPv4 being used or in service already, making this type of internet address depleted and no longer as useful as it once was. IPv6 addresses are a more modern and new type of address with many more allocations that are availbale for use now and in the future. IPv6 has more combinations for new network addresses than IPv4 has, and therefor allows the internet to continue growing.  

**icann** - icann is an organization that distributes blocks of IP addresses to 5 Regional Internet Registeries that are all around the world. icann contributes to global internet by distributing IP addresses to internet service providers or ISP's and then from there the ISP's distibute the addresses accordingly.

### TCP/IP

**Responsibility** - The responsibilty of TCP/IP is to define the protocols or rules between how computers and different network send or recieve data with eachother. It is a universal system when it comes to computers and has made compatibility possible for different computers to essentially communicate.
