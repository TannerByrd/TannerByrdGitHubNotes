# Executive Summary 
The internet is full of all kinds of data and files. TCP/IP is the set of rules for how computers communicate with each other. Every computer has a unique IP address, and IPv6 addresses are the ones of the future. It is extremely important to protect your internet and data. Only visiting secure websites that use HTTP will help with that. Different pages are made with different languages or usually a combination. HTML is a very popular website builder and so is CSS. Languages like XML can help in storing data on a page while HTML and CSS will help with the display or looks of the page. The internet is full of different URL's that consist of several different parts, those being domains, schemes, parameters, file paths, anchors top level domains and second domains. URL's have a lot going on, but it's important to know what each part of a URL link means to fully understand what and where your browser may take you to. This will help you to also understand better ways of protecting your data too. Web page building is fun and requires a lot of work, but can be diverse with enough computer languages and patience. 
# Internet Architecture

### Internet Protocol
An IP address is an internet protocol address and is the numbers assigned to a specific computer network. IPv4 addresses are a used up source of internet adresses, with all the new allocations for new addresses using IPv4 being used, making this type of internet address depleted and no longer as useful as it once was. IPv6 addresses are a more modern and new type of address with many more allocations that are availbale for use now and in the future. IPv6 has more combinations for new network addresses than IPv4 has, and therefore allows the internet to continue growing.  

**icann** - icann is an organization that distributes blocks of IP addresses to 5 Regional Internet Registeries that are all around the world. icann contributes to global internet by distributing IP addresses to internet service providers or ISP's and then from there the ISP's distribute the addresses accordingly.

### TCP/IP

**Responsibility** - The responsibility of TCP/IP is to define the protocols or rules between how computers and different networks send or recieve data with eachother. It is a universal system when it comes to computers and has made compatibility possible for different computers to essentially communicate. 

**Client-Server model** - The client-server model applies to TCP/IP because it is very comparitive to this kind of system. Telephones have  unique numbers that can compare to IP addresses and telephones also have port numbers that can be compared to specific exstensions. The client in this scenario would be the computer that is dialing the phone number, or in other words the IP address. The server would be the computer at the end of the line that is recieving the call or that IP address from the other computer.

**Why layers are important** - Layers are important to changing technology because with layers computer protocols can be much more flexible at being changed or updated. Layers allow for easy and flexible changes within a protocol, changing technology will no doubt need changing protocols to go along with it. These layers are important to us because technology is changing all the time, we need protocols that can keep up with them. 

**Aplication Layer** - The type of applications that run on the application layer would be HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, SNMP

# Internet security 

**HTTP** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP is the protocol that is used to view web pages on the internet. HTTP supports the client-server model because HTTP acts as the the process that retrieves data for your computer or client to recieve data from a web page, or the server.

**HTTP Secure Protocols** - One of the protocols that secure HTTP uses is HTTPS which is Secure Hypertext transfer protocol. HTTPS uses a system that makes it so any data sent to a web page is scrambled into a form that is unreadable so that any hackers cannot read your data. SSL is Secure Sockets Layer. This is a protocol that uses key encryption to protect data. SSL has websites verify their authenticity by asking for a specific certificate. After verification, encrypted data can be shared between you and the web server. TLS or Tranport Layer Security is like an upgraded and more modern version of SSL and does the same thing as SSL but only more efficiently and more modernly. 

# Securing Your Web Browser 

**Why Secure your Web Browser** - You should secure your web browser so that any important data you have will stay protected and so that hackers cannot read any of your data. It is also important to secure your browser to protect your computer from malware or spyware. 

**Risks of Not Securing a Browser** - A risk for web browsing as indicated by the article could be website cookies. Cookies are used by websites to store specific information for that website to access only. If a hacker gained access to a cookie that was used by a website to authenticate a user, then that hacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to that website using that cookie which is a huge privacy problem.   

# Internet Programming 

### World Wide Web Consortium

**Tim Berners-Lee and W3C** - Tim Berners-Lee is the creator of the world wide web and leader at W3C. W3C is the organization that sets the international standards for the internet.

**HTML Standard** - The Web Design and Applications Standard is important because it sets the standards on building or rendering web pages and how these web pages should be internationalized or how they can work on mobile devices. 

**HTML and XML** - XML differs from HTML because it is used to store and transport data and does nothing without a piece of software to go with it. HTML is used to display data, rather than store or transport it. 

# Components of a URL

**Terms and Their Definitions**  

Top Level Domain - .edu is the top level domain as indicated in the end of the Tri-C website: https://www.tri-c.edu/
This is an education top level domain 

Scheme - https is the scheme name as indicated in the beginning of the Tri-C website https://www.tri-c.edu/ 
This is a hypertext transfer protocol scheme

Anchor - specific location on a page. These act as bookmarks and direct you to specific locations on the page.

Domain - www.amazon.com  this is the whole domain for the website amazon, it includes the sub domain, second domain and the top level domain.

Default Page - No File Path Provided The file path is a specific path on a page you can tell your broswer to navigate to. For example, if your wanted to load www.amazon.com but wanted to go into the food category, you could type something like www.amazon.com/food. If you search for just the domain without a file path following it, you will be directed to the default page of that website. 

Parameters - Result of search, the parameters are important for a websites server, and are usually at the end of a domain and can look like clear letters or words but in a lot of cases they look random with different numbers and letters.

# Conclusion

The truth is you need to know what your doing in life, so why shouldn't that same mentality be applied to the online world that so many people almost require to have in their life. Internet saftey is important and steps should be taken to protect your data and keep it safe. The internet has been growing so much that a new line of IP addresses called IPv6 had to be created just to provide more unique
network addresses. If anything the internet will continue to grow so now is a great time to take less risks on the internet and keep your data even more safe from hackers and spyware. Programming will be a very important skill in the future and there may even be a shortage of people in the IT field to fill job request by employers. Learning about the internet, networks, programming, Cybersecurity and the rules of TCP/IP have never seemed more important.
