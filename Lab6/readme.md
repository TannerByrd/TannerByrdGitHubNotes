# Executive Summary 
# Internet Architecture

### Internet Protocol
An IP address is an internet protocol address and is the numbers assigned to a specific computer network. IPv4 addresses are a used up source of internet adresses, with all the new allocations for new addresses using IPv4 being used or in service already, making this type of internet address depleted and no longer as useful as it once was. IPv6 addresses are a more modern and new type of address with many more allocations that are availbale for use now and in the future. IPv6 has more combinations for new network addresses than IPv4 has, and therefor allows the internet to continue growing.  

**icann** - icann is an organization that distributes blocks of IP addresses to 5 Regional Internet Registeries that are all around the world. icann contributes to global internet by distributing IP addresses to internet service providers or ISP's and then from there the ISP's distibute the addresses accordingly.

### TCP/IP

**Responsibility** - The responsibilty of TCP/IP is to define the protocols or rules between how computers and different network send or recieve data with eachother. It is a universal system when it comes to computers and has made compatibility possible for different computers to essentially communicate. 

**Client-Server model** - The client-server model applis to TCP/IP because it is very comparitive to this kind of system. Telephones have  unique numbers that can compare to IP addresses and telephones also have port numbers that can be compared to specific exstensions. The client in this scenario would be the computer that is dialing the phone number, or in other words the IP address. The server would be the computer at the end of the line that is recieving the call or that IP adress from the other computer.

**Why layers are important** - Layers are important to changing technology because with layers computer protocols can be much more flexibe 
at being changed and updated. Layers allow for easy and flxible changes within a protocol, changing technolgoy will no doubt need changing protocols to go along with it. These layers are important to us because technlogy is changing all the time, we need protocols that can keep up with them. 

**Aplication Layer** - The type of applications that run on the application layer would be HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, SNMP

# Internet security 

**HTTP** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP is the protocol that is used to view web pages on the internet. HTTP supports the client-server model because HTTP acts as the the process that retrieves data for your computer or client to recieve data from a web page, or the server.

**HTTP Secure Protocols** - One of the protocols that secure HTTP uses is HTTPs which is Secure Hypertext transfer protocol. HTTPS uses a system that makes it so any data sent to a web page for example from your client or computer is scrambled into a form that is unreadable so that any hackers cannot read your data. SSL is secure sockets layer. This is a protocol that uses key encryption to protect data. SSL has websites verify their authenticity by asking for a specific certificate. After verification encrtpted data can be shared bewteen you can the web server. TLS or tranport Layer Security is like an uprgarded and more modern version of SSL and does the same thing as SSL but only more efficiently and more modernly. 

# Securing your web browser 

**Why Secure your Web Browser** - You should secure your web browser so that any important data you have will stay protected and so that hackers cannot read any of your data. It is also important to secure your browser to protect your computer form malware or spyware. 

**Risks of Not Securing a browser** - A risk for web browsing as indicated by the article could be website cookies. Cookies are used by websites to store specific information for that website to access only. If a hacker gained access to a cookie that was used by a website to authenticate a user, then that hacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to that website using that cookie which is a huge privacy problem.   

# Internet Programming 

### World Wide Web Consortium

**Tim Berners-Lee and W3C** Tim Berners-Lee is the creator of the world wide web and leader at W3C. W3C is the organization that sets the international standards for the world wide web

**HTML Standard** - The Web Design and Applications Standard is important because it sets the standards on building or rendering web pages and how these web pages could be internationalied, how they can work on mobile devices, and how these web pages can be accessible to people with disabilities.
