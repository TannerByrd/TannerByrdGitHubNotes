# Executive Summary 
Files come in all sizes. It is important to know how to zip, unzip and compress a file. Python is a strong programming tool and language. Using Python you are able to code many things. Python is a very creative langauge. UML is a great and powerful tool for software developers.   

### File Compression 

**Purpose of file compression** - The purpose of file compression is to essentially make an original file smaller in memory size and this is done to save on memory space and also to make the transfer of this file from different computers easier and faster.

**Compressed JPG File** - If the file compressed in our class lab was a JPG file rather than an SVG file then the JPG file would of course still be smaller in memory size but also the JPG file image would have less quality.

### Object Oriented Programming

**Methods and property of the Shark Class** - The methods of the Shark class is "self" and the property of the shark class is the "print" property.

**Constructor** - The purpose of a constructor is to initialize data.

**Class vs. an object and what it means to "instantiate an object from a class?"** - A class is a blueprint for an object, meaning the class will represent an object. The class is the thing that defines the object and the object is the thing that is set or defined by that class. What it means to Instantiate an object from a class is essentially creating an object using a class. 

### Unified Modeling Language
# Python IDLE
The shell and file editor in Python IDLE are both different because the shell has the three angle brackets that the editor does not have. The shell is where you run and test code and the file editor is where you take that code to write and complete it.
# Code Examples

I.
Spam = 'Hello'. A Variable holds a single set value. The author includes the spam, bacon and eggs example because these terms are used in Python tutorials because of Monty Pythons comedy sketch "spam".

II.
Spam = spam + 1 is an example of an assignment statement. Assignment statements don't evaluate to a single value.

III.
Print (name) is an example of a function. Functions in Python allow you to display the string values that are set in parenthesis. 

IIII.
Data types consist of strings, integers or floating point numbers. Data types are category of values.

# Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster images are images that are made up of thousands or millions of tiny pixels, and they lose quality as you zoom in on this type of image. Raster images are best used for unprfossional purposes or for images that will not for any reason need to be zoomed in on. Vector graphics are images made using an advanced form of geometry and these images do not lose quality when being zoomed in on. These images are best used in professional places or for images that are constantly zoomed in on.

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Using lossless or lossy image formats matters because the quality of an image may be much better with lossless compression, however the image file will be larger. Lossless compression makes the image file smaller, but also makes the quality of the image lesser.  

### File Formats
JPEG, PNG and GIF image formats all allow an image to be present within their respective files, however GIF's allow animation of it's images and can hold up to 8 bits of data per pixel. JPEG's allow an image files data to be compressed to take up less computer resources but results in a poorer quality image. PNG allows for lossless data compression to result in a higher quality image, this file format also allows for transparency. 

# File Properties 

I. I chose to make my image design a skateboard logo design. The idea came to me from Stereo Skateboards, a skateboard designing company that makes professional skateboards. The image required 8 layers total and a couple different colors to make it look less plain.  

II.

The file size for my image design is 54.8 KB and on my disk it takes up a total of 56.0 KB. This application originally opened with Internet Explorer, however I thought it would be more efficient for it to open with Google Chrome so I changed it. 


**OMG and purpose of UML** OMG is an international technology standards organization. The purpose of UML is to provide a tool to all sorts of software creators for use in analysis, design, and implementation of their software systems. 

**Terms and their definitions** -
Object: Sammy - The term "Sammy" is an example of a set object in a class in the coding language of Python, the class sets the object and in the case of the reading the term "sammy" is the object with it's own defined principles.

Class: shark - Shark is a defined class in Python. The class name is "shark" according to the reading.  

Abstraction: swim(self) - These two are matched together because swim(self) is an entity of a real world behavior.

encapsulation: definition of a shark - These are matched because a class is what binds data together. 

inheritance: a specific type of shark - These are matched because a specific classes are made using existing ones such as shark.

# Conclusion
Programming and coding can include many difficult things but in the end it's all worth learning because the more you know the more creative you can be with your coding. knowledge is power when it comes to coding and knowing different aspects of information technology like how to zip or unzip a file is just as important. Thanks to tools like UML the future in programming is strong and always getting stronger.
