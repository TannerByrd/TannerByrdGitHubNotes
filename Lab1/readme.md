# Executive summary 
Information Systems are a large part of todays society. These Information Systems are composed of many different technological things, such as Hardware, Software, and Data. Hardware is typically the physical aspects of such systems, the parts that make up the actual tangible pieces making up that information system. For example a computer has it's CPU, Motherboard, Video card, Hard drive, PSU, Keyboard, Mouse, Disc Tray and so much more. These are the physical pieces of hardware for that Information System, which is in this case the computer. Software is the piece of such an information Systems that you cannot touch. Software is the set of commands or languages that tell the hardware what to do. You could think of Software as a set of instructions for it's fellow hardware, without it the hardware is usless, and ultimatley that computer is usless.  Of course, without the power of communication across an information System, it renders it extremley limited and therefore less powerful. You can't collect nearly as much Data without communication. Also, your options and choices for new and helpful pieces of software are much more limited without the access of communication. You can see why an information System needs access to communication.To connect to other devices and local or global networks.
