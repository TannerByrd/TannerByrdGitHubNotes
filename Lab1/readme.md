# Executive summary 
Information Systems are a large part of todays society. These Information Systems are composed of many different technological things, such as Hardware, Software, Data and Communication. Hardware is typically the physical aspects of such systems, the parts that make up the actual tangible pieces making up that information system. For example a computer has it's CPU, Motherboard, Video card, Hard drive, PSU, Keyboard, Mouse, Disc Tray and so much more. These are the physical pieces of hardware for that Information System, which is in this case the computer. Software is the piece of such an information System that you cannot touch. Software is the set of commands or languages that tells the hardware what to do. You could think of Software as a set of instructions for it's fellow hardware, without it the hardware is useless, and ultimatley that computer is useless. Data is a strong and helpful thing for an information system to use. Data is the collection of valuable information that may help the purpose of that information system. For example, Google, which is an advanced piece of software, collects data such as their users search results, parts of the world they live in and more, to help project ads and direct them to websites that they may actually want to click on. Google uses data to improve the number of results their search engine recieves, and therefore attracting more advertisers to a more populated platform. Google also uses data to improve how a particular user may or may not see an ad. It is more profitable and efficient for google to have people who interact with the ads they choose to show. Google uses data to project the right ads to the right users. If you use Google to look up tractors and scooters, then you are more likley to see ads on their platform that are promoting tractors and scooters. This is because google is using Data to improve how their organization operates, and Google is more profitable because of the utilization of Data. Of course, without the power of communication across an information System, it renders it extremley limited and therefore less powerful. Without communication, your information system is basically alone in the world. Without any option to connect to other networks, devices, and other information systems.  You can't collect nearly as much Data without communication. Also, your options and choices for new and helpful pieces of software are much more limited without the access of communication. You can see why an information System needs access to communication. One of the biggest examples of communication could be internet. The pieces of an Information System that are not technological, would be People and Process. The people element to an Information System would be that these systems exist for people. They exist to improve the lives of people and organizations. People are the reason why these Information Systems continue doing their job properly. People benefit from these Information Systems. For example the cash register is an Information System and it's faster at getting customer sale transactions complete, as opposed to having handwritten reciepts and doing math without the cash register. Processes is the last composition of an Information System. A process is the line up of actions, measures or movements taken to reach a specific goal. More organized procceses allow better optimization and improvability over a said process. Which results in a more efficient Information System
