# Executive summary 
Information Systems are a large part of today's society. These Information Systems are composed of many different technological aspects, such as Hardware, Software, Data and Communication. Information Systems are also composed of non-technical aspects such as processes and people. Organizations and businesses use Information Systems to improve productivity and optimization. Mainframes were introduced in the 1950's. These early computers were very large but did what they were made to do. They were used to store large amounts of information, making it easier for organizations to perform calculations. In the 1960's, a new piece of software named Manufacturing Resources Planning or MRP was introduced to mainframes that allowed them to operate even more efficiently. These machines were now being used to keep counts on inventory, schedule production and even manage manufacturing processes. A company named IBM proved to be the strongest Mainframes manufacturers and continued to improve the machines and eventually introduced the Minicomputer. In 1975 the first Microcomputer was introduced as Altair 8800. The Microcomputer gained vast popularity and was improved upon quickly.
