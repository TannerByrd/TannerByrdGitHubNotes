# Executive summary 
Information Systems are a large part of today's society. These Information Systems are composed of many different technological aspects, such as Hardware, Software, Data and Communication. Information Systems are also composed of non-technical aspects such as processes and people. Organizations and businesses use Information Systems to improve productivity and optimization. Mainframes were introduced in the 1950's. These early computers were very large but did what they were made to do. They were used to store large amounts of information, making it easier for organizations to perform calculations. In the 1960's, a new piece of software named Manufacturing Resources Planning or MRP was introduced to mainframes that allowed them to operate even more efficiently. These machines were now being used to keep counts on inventory, schedule production and even manage manufacturing processes. A company named IBM proved to be the strongest Mainframes manufacturers and continued to improve the machines and eventually introduced the Minicomputer. In 1975 the first Microcomputer was introduced as Altair 8800. The Microcomputer gained vast popularity and was improved upon quickly. Companies such as Apple and Microsoft began building these computers. IBM teamed up with Microsoft and eventually released the IBM PC. This PC became very popular and offered services such as word processing, spreadsheets and databases. In the 1980's Organizations and businesses started to connect to other computers using Client Server and Local Area Connection. Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP and this software allowed an organization to operate much of it's business with the computer such as human Resouces and accounting. Soon after in the 1980's companies began to connect to an early version of the Internet. In 1989 the World Wide Web was invented and changed the entire way the internet worked. Web pages could be created and interactive websites would follow. This Internet revolution moved very quickly and allowed online marketplace such as Ebay or Amazon. Online technologies and businesses put video store and travel agencies out of business. Many pieces of software have been invented to improve how the computer can be used as a legendary Information System and just recently tablets and smartphones have become more popular than the PC that has dominated the industry for many years.
