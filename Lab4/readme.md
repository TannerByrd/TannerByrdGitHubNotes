# Python IDLE
The Shell and file editor in Python IDLE are both different because the shell has the three angle brackets that the editor does not have. The shell is where you run and test code and the file editor is where you take that code to write and complete it.
# Code Examples

I.
Spam = 'Hello'. A Variable holds a single set value. The author includes the spam, bacon and eggs example because these terms are used in Python tutorials because of Monty Pythons comedy sketch "spam".

II.
Spam = spam + 1 is an example of an assignment statement. Assignment statements don't evaluate to a single value.

III.
Print (name) is an example of a function. Functions in Python allow you to display the string values that are set in parenthesis. 

IIII.
Data types consist of strings, integers or floating point numbers. Data types are category of values.

# Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster images are images that are made up of thousands or millions of tiny pixels, and they lose quality as you zoom in on this type of image. Raster images are best used for unprfossional purposes or for images that will not for any reason need to be zoomed in on. Vector graphics are images made using an advanced form of geometry and these images do not lose quality when being zoomed in on. These images are best used in professional places or for images that are constantly zoomed in on.

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Using lossless or lossy image formats matters because the quality of an image may be much better with lossless compression, however the image file will be larger. Lossless compression makes the image file smaller, but also makes the quality of the image lesser.  

### File Formats
JPEG, PNG and GIF image formats all allow an image to be present within their respective files, however GIF's allow animation of it's images and can hold up to 8 bits of data per pixel. JPEG's allow an image files data to be compressed to take up less computer resources but results in a poorer quality image. PNG allows for lossless data compression to result in a higher quality image, this file format also allows for transparency. 

# File Properties 

I. I chose to make my image design a skateboard logo design. The idea came to me from Stereo Skateboards, a skateboard designing company that makes professional skateboards. The image required 8 layers total and a couple different colors to make it look less plain.  

II.

The file size for my image design is 54.8 KB and on my disk it takes up a total of 56.0 KB. This application originally opened with Internet Explorer, however I thought it would be more efficient for it to open with Google Chrome so I changed it.
