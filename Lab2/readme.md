# Executive Summary 
### Hardware
Hard Drives and Memory - The differences between Latency and Tranfer rates within a Hard Drive would be that Latency is normally measured in milliseconds and Transfer Rates would normally be measured in megabytes per second or MBps. Latency affects Hard Drives in two ways, Seek Time and Rotational Latency. Seek Time in a Hard Drive is the time it takes that Hard Drives read/write heads to locate physical  pieces of data. Rotational Latency is the time it takes for that Hard Drive to rotate under the read/write head for that data to be located. Transfer Rates within a Hard drive are the speeds at which data is tranferred to and from the Hard Drives actual disk platters. These Tranfer Rates also help in the process of recording data. The faster the Seek time, the Transfer Rate and the slower the Rotational latency is within a Hard Drive, the faster it will perform. In other words, It will save, send, recieve and read or write data more quickly and efficiently.
