# Executive Summary 
### Hardware
Hard Drives and Memory - The differences between Latency and Tranfer rates within a Hard Drive would be that Latency is normally measured in milliseconds and Transfer Rates would normally be measured in megabytes per second or MBps. Latency affects Hard Drives in two ways, Seek Time and Rotational Latency. Seek Time in a Hard Drive is the time it takes that Hard Drives read/write heads to locate physical  pieces of data. Rotational Latency is the time it takes for that Hard Drive to rotate under the read/write head for that data to be located. Transfer Rates within a Hard drive are the speeds at which data is tranferred to and from the Hard Drives actual disk platters. These Tranfer Rates also help in the process of recording data. The faster the Seek time, the Transfer Rate and the slower the Rotational latency is within a Hard Drive, the faster it will perform. In other words, It will save, send, recieve and read or write data more quickly and efficiently.

SSD versus traditional Hard Drives - Solid State Hard Drives are different from traditional Hard Drives because while Traditonal Drives do have disks to store their data, Solid State Drives do not. Solid State Drives also do not have heads, platters or magnetic surfaces so that they do not fail as often as traditional Drives, due to physical errors. It is said that data is read at the speed of light with Solid State Drives, whereas Traditional Drives need to start spinning for the head to read the platter or disk withint the drive. This takes more time and proves Solid State Drives to be more efficient. Unlike Traditional Drives, Solid State Drives do not cause delay in performance when it comes to fragmenting data.
