# Executive Summary 
Hardware is a very important component to computers today as we know it. Computers have become a part of many things such as cars, refridgerators and many other things that were once computer free. Computers today run on a 64 processor bit system, the first personal ones only ran on 8 bits of data. Digital Devices are in most if not all computers and these run through a process or system called Binary Code. Personal computers today have Hardware that include a circuit board, storage, CPU or central processor unit, memory and input or output devices. The CPU is the brains of a computer, two main companies produce CPU's which today are genrally smapp chips that mount into the circuit board. Those two companies are Intel and AMD. CPU's power range is measures in Hertz. Computer technology gets improved every year. Moores Law defines that computing technology will double every two years for the same price point. Motherboards are the host pieces of a computer or circuit boards that the other pieces of software connect into, such as video cards, RAM or memory units. RAM is Random Access Memory and it load information from a hard disk or hard drive. RAM cannot save data or information because after it is powered off memory is lost within it. RAM processes information much faster than any Hard Drive. More RAM will make a computer run faster. Hard drives or Hard Disks is what the computer will use for longer term storage. Hard drives can store data even when not powered on, unlike RAM. SSD or Solid State Drives are Hard Drives that use flash memory and are much more eficient compared to Hard Disk Drives. External storage is another important piece of hardware people use to store data in a more portable way. Examples of these portable pices of information holders would be floppy disks or USB flash drives. Network access abilities began to be standard in most computers due to the need to connect to other computers to share information more easily. Network cards were first installed in personal computers following a network port that people now would refer to as an ethernet connection port. USB ports became common on most computers due to the fact that an input and output connection needed established with the computer to transfer data. Bluetooth connection also is an input and output connection for some computers, provinding a wireless connection that allows the tranfer of data. Input of data on a computer may include the keyboard, the mouse or eve touchscren capabilities within a computer. Output of data in a computer may include the screen or monitor, speakers for listeing to audio, or even a printer. Different form of computers have been invented to meet the needs of different expectations and requirements, such as Portable computers, smart phones, tablets or even intergrated computers that make better use of things such as a refridgerator or car, as stated earlier. Hardware in a computer is just as important as it's software, provinding tangible interchangible pieces that make up your computer.    

### Hardware
Hard Drives and Memory - The differences between Latency and Tranfer rates within a Hard Drive would be that Latency is normally measured in milliseconds and Transfer Rates would normally be measured in megabytes per second or MBps. Latency affects Hard Drives in two ways, Seek Time and Rotational Latency. Seek Time in a Hard Drive is the time it takes that Hard Drives read/write heads to locate physical  pieces of data. Rotational Latency is the time it takes for that Hard Drive to rotate under the read/write head for that data to be located. Transfer Rates within a Hard drive are the speeds at which data is tranferred to and from the Hard Drives actual disk platters. These Tranfer Rates also help in the process of recording data. The faster the Seek time, the Transfer Rate and the slower the Rotational latency is within a Hard Drive, the faster it will perform. In other words, It will save, send, recieve and read or write data more quickly and efficiently.


SSD versus traditional Hard Drives - Solid State Hard Drives are different from Traditional Hard Drives because while Traditonal Drives do have disks to store their data, Solid State Drives do not. Solid State Drives also do not have heads, platters or magnetic surfaces so that they do not fail as often as Traditional Drives, due to physical errors. It is said that data is read at the speed of light with Solid State Drives, whereas Traditional Drives need to start spinning for the head to read the platter or disk within the drive. This takes more time and proves Solid State Drives to be more efficient. Unlike Traditional Drives, Solid State Drives do not cause delay in performance when it comes to fragmenting data.

Why increased RAM makes a computer faster - Increased RAM makes a computer run faster because it provides more storage for data to travel through, data needs to travel through the RAM first before it can go anywhere else, if there is not enough room on the RAM storage of a computer than that data instead of traveling directly through the RAM then needs to travel back to the Hard Drive where there sis more storage avaiolble. This creates extra work for your computer to do and ultimatley causes it be act more slowly overall.
