# Executive Summary 
Files come in all sizes. It is important to know how to zip, unzip and compress a file. Python is a strong programming tool and language. Using Python you are able to code many things. Python is a very creative langauge. UML is a great and powerful tool for software developers.   

### File Compression 

**Purpose of file compression** - The purpose of file compression is to essentially make an original file smaller in memory size and this is done to save on memory space and also to make the transfer of this file from different computers easier and faster.

**Compressed JPG File** If the file compressed in our class lab was a JPG file rather than a SVG file then the JPG file would of course still be smaller in memory size but also the JPG file image would have less quality.

### Object Oriented Programming

**Methods and property of the Shark Class** - The methods of the Shark class is "self" and the property of the shark class is the "print" property.

**Constructor** - The purpose of a constructor is to initialize data.

**Class vs. an object and what it means to "instantiate an object from a class?"** - A class is a blueprint for an object, meaning the class will represent an object. The class is the thing that defines the object and the object is the thing that is set or defined by that class. What it means to Instantiate an object from a class is essentially creating an object using a class. 

### Unified Modeling Language

**OMG and purpose of UML** OMG is an international technology standards organization. The purpose of UML is to provide a tool to all sorts of software creators for use in analysis, design, and implementation of their software systems. 

**Terms and their definitions** -
Object: Sammy - The term "Sammy" is an example of a set object in a class in the coding language of Python, the class sets the object and in the case of the reading the term "sammy" is the object with it's own defined principles.

Class: shark - Shark is a defined class in Python. The class name is "shark" according to the reading.  

Abstraction: swim(self) - These two are matched together because swim(self) is an entity of a real world behavior.

encapsulation: definition of a shark - These are matched because a class is what binds data together. 

inheritance: a specific type of shark - These are matched because a specific classes are made using existing ones such as shark.

# Conclusion
Programming and coding can include many difficult things but in the end it's all worth learning because the more you know the more creative you can be with your coding. knowledge is power when it comes to coding and knowing different aspects of information technology like how to zip or unzip a file is just as important. Thanks to tools like UML the future in programming is strong and always getting stronger.
